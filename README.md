an unnecessary middleman of a script that allows users to make a to-do list

to keep myself interested in learning python, i like to instantly gratify myself with projects that are easy to do, however useless they may be
i was inspired to make a to-do list since recently making a new friend who left his job at Google to pursue his own ventures to create a productivity application
althought that doesn't sound as sexy as most young startup/venture, i think it's really an important endeavor, and i hope for his best

my particular to-do list script is so simple i'm a bit embarrassed to be proud of it
throughout writing this script, i realized the irony in using something text-based to create a to-do list that is in its nature, text-based

anyways, it didn't take too long, but i think it helped keep me interested in learning python
thanks, later
